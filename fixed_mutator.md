# Digital Red Queen: Fixed Mutator Analysis

## Overview

The DRQ paper from SakanaAI investigates Red Queen dynamics in LLM-driven evolution—an important research direction. But how effective are the results obtained by this method? What happens if we retain the MAP-Elites optimization framework but modify or replace other components? While this no longer constitutes "Red Queen dynamics" per se, it provides valuable insights, especially if we can achieve significantly better results through alternative optimization approaches.

An [analysis of the DRQ publication](https://github.com/dietmarwo/drq_fast_mars/blob/master/drq_analysis.md) written by Claude Opus 4.5 identifies several key design decisions worth examining:

- **MAP-Elites niching**: The DRQ paper demonstrates that MAP-Elites, specifically their niche separation strategy, works well for Core War warrior optimization. We retain this component to enable fair comparison when modifying other aspects. We also keep the 317 human-written warriors from their GitHub repository as a reference benchmark.

- **LLM mutation overhead**: Calling the LLM for each mutation utilizes fixed human knowledge inefficiently. An alternative approach uses the LLM to generate a Python mutation script once, then applies it repeatedly. The disadvantage is that all knowledge must be encoded upfront—the model cannot react dynamically to optimization progress. However, this enables dramatically more iterations, which may compensate for reduced flexibility.

- **Self-play vs. fixed opponents**: How does self-play compare to optimization against a fixed opponent set? Does this replicate Google's AlphaZero findings that self-play is superior? Note that AlphaZero uses only game rules, whereas our LLM-based mutator incorporates human Core War expert knowledge.

- **Multi-warrior vs. 1v1 evaluation**: How do multi-warrior results (simultaneous competition) used in the DRQ paper relate to 1v1 hill-scoring (3 points for a win), which is the standard metric for warrior performance?

## DRQ Baseline Results

The DRQ paper presents two specific "generalized" warriors. Since generalization is the primary goal, we use these warriors as benchmarks for our modified optimization approach. The paper evaluates them against human-written bots using 2-warrior runs with multi-warrior scoring.

This differs from classical King of the Hill (KotH) one-on-one tournament scoring, which doesn't incorporate survival time. Multi-warrior scoring is typically reserved for battles involving more than two bots. 

Our approach uses fixed, diverse, curated warrior sets for both optimization and preliminary evaluation. Final evaluation computes both KotH hill scoring and 2-warrior scoring against all 317 human-written warriors. This reveals which fitness method generalizes better: self-play or a fixed curated opponent set. We investigate both multi-warrior and 1v1 scoring, each with its own curated opponent set.

Beyond random initialization, we also test whether existing human-written warriors can be improved by initializing the population with a curated opponent set. Note that improvements against the curated set don't guarantee improvements against all 317 opponents.

We acknowledge that changing multiple variables simultaneously limits insight into individual contributions. We leave ablation studies for future research. However, the changes may be interdependent—perhaps the fixed mutator works better with a fixed opponent set—making isolated testing less informative.

## Methodology

### Required Tools

To investigate these questions, we developed several tools:

- **Evaluation framework**: Compares any set of warriors, particularly the 317 human-written ones, using both multi-warrior scoring against a given opponent set and 1v1 round-robin tournaments with hill scoring.

- **AI-generated fixed mutators**: Specialized mutation scripts for both multi-warrior and 1v1 optimization, with warm-start capability for continuing interrupted runs.

- **Optimizers**: MAP-Elites-based optimizers using the evaluation methods above, one for multi-warrior fitness and one for 1v1 hill scoring. These use the fixed AI-generated mutators with sophisticated parallelization (more efficient than the original implementation).

- **Fast simulation**: Since mutation is now much faster (no LLM calls), simulator speed becomes critical. Our Numba-accelerated simulator provides a 4× speedup, which is essential for this approach.

### Why Separate Multi-Warrior and 1v1?

From the KotH FAQ:
> "Classical" KotH is a one-on-one tournament where your warrior plays a set number of battles against each program currently on the Hill. You receive 3 points for each win and 1 point for each tie.

The two evaluation modes have fundamentally different dynamics:

| Aspect | Multi-Warrior | 1v1 |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Goal** | Survive longest | Kill opponent |
| **Ties** | Rare (someone usually wins) | Common (both survive) |
| **Papers** | Excellent (many processes = survival) | Mediocre (replicate but don't kill) |
| **Scanners** | Weak (spread thin) | Strong (focused attack) |
| **Stone/Bomber** | Good | Excellent (must destroy) |
| **SPL fan** | Great for survival | Less valuable |

Warriors "learn" different strategies depending on whether optimization uses multi-warrior or 1v1 fitness. By running both, we make this difference transparent.

### Curated Opponent Set Selection

How do we select diverse but small reference opponent sets? We leverage the MAP-Elites niching from the original DRQ code:

**Initialization**: Manually select a random subset from the 317 warriors.

**Iterative refinement**:
1. Rank all 317 warriors using the current opponent set
2. Apply MAP-Elites niching to identify niche winners
3. These niche winners become the new opponent set
4. Repeat until convergence

The final niche winners serve as reference opponents. We create separate sets for multi-warrior and 1v1 evaluation, testing whether these sets are sufficiently diverse to avoid overfitting—i.e., whether optimization results generalize to the full 317-warrior tournament.

## Conclusion

The two warriors from the DRQ paper exhibit vastly different performance characteristics:

**Ring_Warrior_Enhanced_v9**: Average multi-warrior performance, poor 1v1 performance against curated opponents, slightly better against the full 317-warrior set.

**Spiral_Bomber_Optimized_v22**: Weak multi-warrior performance, but strong 1v1 performance against both curated and full opponent sets.

Spiral_Bomber_Optimized_v22's 1v1 performance is remarkable given that it was optimized using multi-warrior scoring in self-play. It matches random_init_1v1_fixed_mutator, both achieving rank 11 in the full ranking. Both show similar weakness in multi-warrior evaluation. One explanation is that per-mutation LLM calls provide a genuine advantage through dynamic adaptation. However, this seems unpredictable given Ring_Warrior_Enhanced_v9's poor performance. An alternative explanation is that self-play includes training against weaker opponents during evolution, which may facilitate gradual improvement. In contrast, our curated opponent sets are optimized for their respective evaluation modes and contain only strong warriors in each niche.

**Our results align with expectations:**

1. **Multi-warrior training doesn't generalize to 1v1**: Warriors trained with multi-warrior fitness underperform Spiral_Bomber_Optimized_v22 in 1v1 evaluation. This holds even for curated_init_multi_fixed_mutator, which starts from the best multi-warrior performers among the 317 warriors. This confirms that multi-warrior fitness doesn't generalize well to 1v1 performance.

2. **1v1 training matches or exceeds DRQ results**: Warriors trained with 1v1 fitness perform equal to or better than Spiral_Bomber_Optimized_v22 in 1v1 evaluation.

3. **Excellent performance against training targets**: Multi-warrior-trained warriors achieve exceptional scores against the curated multi-warrior opponent set, outperforming all 317 human-written warriors. Performance might improve further with more MAP-Elites niches (larger curated sets) or direct optimization against all 317 opponents (though computationally expensive).

4. **Curated initialization advantage**: curated_init_1v1_fixed_mutator benefits from initializing with the curated test set rather than random warriors—a form of warm-starting that provides an advantage.

5. **DRQ claims are replicable**: Spiral_Bomber_Optimized_v22 fulfills the paper's generalization promise, but comparable results can be achieved using fixed opponents and fixed mutator code generated by Claude Opus 4.5—without per-mutation LLM calls or self-play dynamics.

### Key Takeaway

The DRQ paper's core contribution—demonstrating that LLM-guided evolution can produce competitive Core War warriors—is validated. However, the specific mechanism (self-play with per-mutation LLM calls) may not be essential. A simpler approach using fixed opponents and pre-generated mutation code achieves comparable or superior results with dramatically lower computational cost.
